      <div class="subcontent">  Proprius is an autonomous interactive sound
      environment, where the sonification of animal behavior within an ecological
      simulation is used to create an interactive augmented reality music
      composition. The consecutive layers of a food chain are used as movements
      that dictate the temporal progression of the composition. The listener
      explores a physical space augmented with Proprius to experience the
      compositional unfolding of the ecosystem. The listener’s presence in the
      system affects nearby organisms; the listener is thereby situated as an
      interactive agent that contributes to the progression of the work.</div><br>

  <div class="subtitle"> Selected Fixed Pieces </div>

    <div class="subtitle"> <em>Inconnu</em> </div>
        <div class="subcontent"> Inconnu is composed for 20-channels. Each sound (20 different entities in my
imagination) is designed for separate speakers, but each channel is considered
to be laid out in a linear fashion where one sound could only  travel into
adjacent channels, implying a strict directionality. However, the loudspeakers
for the performance are placed on separate levels and asymmetrical spots in the
construction in a non-linear fashion. Furthermore, when the piece travels in
space, the structure itself adds various effects beyond what the composition
affords and further interrupts the linearity of the sonic trajectories.  Through
the specialization scheme I follow for the performance of the piece, I aim to
obscure the trajectories I determined during the composition process.   By
blurring these trajectories with an uneven dispersion of speakers and the
resonant characteristics  of the structure, I choreograph a metaphor for how an
individual’s path should be ambiguous and distinctive. Still, through close
listening, the audience can untangle this ambiguity and recognize the underlying
trajectories that are deeply embedded into the composition.  </div>

</iframe>

<div class="subtitle"> <em>As if I didn’t</em> </div>
    <div class="subcontent"> As if I didn’t is a made up soundscape of a dream. Composed of field recordings,
it tells a story of an individual’s struggle with waking up, as the person in
the composition tries to find her way through a synthetic environment of
abstract and real objects. The piece starts with a gloomy atmosphere that
includes very few representational sounds. But as the piece moves forward, a
balance between concrete and abstract sounds emerge to signal the individuals’
“ascent” to consciousness, This consciousness, however, swings back and forth
between reality and a dream. The final gesture blows the whistle on the
narrative of the piece. </div>

<div class="subtitle"> <em>Connotation</em> </div>
    <div class="subcontent"> Connotation is composed from the recorded material (e.g. trumpet) that has been
    electronically manipulated and Frequency Modulation implemented in MAX.
    I tried to eliminate the source of the sound as much as possible. Instead of following a story that I try to tell,
    this time, I wanted the audience imagine based on their previous
    experiences about sound. Additionally, I tried to impose traditional musical
    form to create a sense of structure and association. </div>

    <div class="subtitle"> <em>Smoke and Mirrors (Butka)</em> </div> <div
    class="subcontent"> Butka can be used as referring to the elite in Lubunca
    which is the language/argot of Turkey’s LGBTQ community. Butka is usually
    used for smarty, brag, beautiful or rich people. Depending on the context,
    it can be used as an insult, a desire for something or implying high class
    (in a sarcastic way) events or people. I used a scripted scenario and
    performer (a hidden audience) during the performance. The performer used the
    script and improvised. During the performance,
    we listen to the ideas of the performer about the concert they are currently
    in. At the beginning of the piece, thier phone rings and they realize
    that they don't remember how they got there. After a while, they realize that
    they hear their own voice in the composition. The piece was performed in
    no-light environment with a seated audience. After the performance, the
    lights turned on and I showed the audience the performer who sat in the
    middle of them. Some of them looked surprised. One of them (the one who sat
    next to the performer) told me that he thought I used wave field synthesis
    because he heard the takings in the composition as if someone was sitting
    next to him (which literally was the case). I also observed that some of the
    audience tried to silence the performer during the performance because they
    thought they were being disrespectful by talking on the phone with someone
    else (that was also part of the script).</div> <iframe width="100%"
